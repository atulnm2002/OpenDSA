.. slide:: Linear Probing by Steps

   * Instead of going to the next slot, skip by some constant c.
      * Warning: Pick M and c carefully.

   * This effectively splits the key range, and the hash table, into
     two halves. This leads to reduced performance.


.. slide:: Linear Probing by Steps (2)

   * The probe sequence SHOULD cycle through all slots of the table.
      * Pick :math:`c` to be relatively prime to :math:`M`.

.. slide:: Analysis of Closed Hashing

   The load factor is :math:`\alpha = N/M` where :math:`N` is the
   number of records currently in the table.

.. slide:: Deletion

   * Deleting a record must not hinder later searches.

   * We do not want to make positions in the hash table unusable because of
     deletion.

   * Both of these problems can be resolved by placing a special mark in
     place of the deleted record, called a tombstone.

   * A tombstone will not stop a search, but that slot can be used for
     future insertions.

.. slide:: Tombstones (2)

   * Unfortunately, tombstones add to the average path length.

   * Solutions:
      #. Local reorganizations to try to shorten the average path length.
      #. Periodically rehash the table (by order of most frequently accessed
         record).
